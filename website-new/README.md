## Local development

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

The **Deploy** page searches Docker Hub for public images. Because Docker Hub's search API does not send CORS headers, the browser tries the API directly first, then falls back to a public CORS proxy for local/development origins. For a production deployment you will want to replace the proxy with your own backend endpoint.
